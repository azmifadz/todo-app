## Working with Translations üåê

This project use [easy_localization][easy_localization_link] to handle internationalization.

# Adding Strings

To add a new localizable string, open the en-US.json file at "assets/translations/en_US.json".

# Generate translation keys

Keys must be generated after updating translation json file by using this command:

```
flutter pub run easy_localization:generate -S assets/translations -f keys -O lib/app/translations -o locale_keys.g.dart
```
